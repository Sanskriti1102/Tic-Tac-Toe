# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation which is a part of Devtown Python & Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp that offers both a single-player mode against an AI opponent and a multiplayer mode for two players. 
The game allows users to play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game on the command line interface.

### Features:

#### Single Player Mode:
In this mode, the player competes against an AI opponent. The AI utilizes the Minimax algorithm to make intelligent moves and provide a challenging gameplay experience.
#### Multiplayer Mode: 
This mode enables two players to play against each other on the same machine. Players take turns entering their moves, and the game determines the winner based on the standard Tic-Tac-Toe rules.
#### Interactive Interface: 
The program provides a user-friendly and interactive interface where players can see the current state of the board after each move.

### How to Play:
Choose the game mode: Single Player (against AI) or Multiplayer.
#### For Single Player mode:
-Select your player symbol: X or O.
-Make your moves by entering the position number on the board (from 1 to 9).
-The AI opponent will make its move based on the Minimax algorithm.
#### For Multiplayer mode:
-Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) take turns making their moves.
-Enter the position number on the board to place your symbol.
-The game ends when a player wins or the game board is full, resulting in a draw.
